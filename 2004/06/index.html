            <p>At last</p>

<p>I cannot believe that Nora is now 12 weeks old so it is about time that I updated this page.</p>

<p>Things here are pretty hectic as only The Woolseys can be and luckily Nora seems to be fine with it. She is becoming quite her own little person and we have taken to parenthood far better than we ever imagined.  As with all you parents out there you only realise what you were missing when it happens to you.  No-one can prepare you for the ranges of emotions that emerge from within your deepest soul.  It's incredible.  So now we are doting parents and Duf is trying to figure out how small a crash helmet he can get and when will she be able to  go on the motorbike.</p>

<p>That is the new motorbike that he bought himself for his birthday. A Triumph Bonneville Thruxten for those who are interested. He picked it up on the morning of his birthday and went off with the boys for a ride. The other Bonneville (the old one) is also on the road although it only for special occasions.  And Duf is racing the G50 next weekend. So to answer your question Peter no -  fatherhood hasn't changed the motorbiking passion. It is now just a little further down the list. Nora was the first person to sit on the new bike. </p>

<p>We are now in the middle of winter and is great to be a little quieter. Mind you it is almost the end of our financial year and there is loads to do so we don't seem to have much free time at the moment but it will come. We celebrated our anniversary of being in Australia a whole year this week and can't believe what a year it has been. We have decided to have a relatively quiet year this year and not fit so much in to it.  We will see if that actually happens.</p>

<p>Hope you are all well and I am slowly catching up on replying to my e-mails now that I have a computer and an office at home.  I just have to try and get into a routine and all will be well. Nora isn't sleeping through the nights as yet but she only wakes up once which is great. Mind you the first time she went from twice  to once we were up and sneeking into her room to check if she was alright. how many of you have done that? I'm sure routine is something that we just have to get organised with. She seems to thrive on the mad lives that we have. She will sleep anywhere, smiles at everyone and probably thinks it's a bit boring if we have a day at home.  </p>

<p>Let me know what you are all up to. </p>

<p>With love </p>
