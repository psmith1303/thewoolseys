                                        <p>Hi everyone</p>

<p>I am sorry it has taken so long to update this. Like I have said so many times before time just flies away. I hope you are all well and you know it is only 11 weeks to Christmas. Oh No!!</p>

<p>We are all really well and summer has definitly come early this year with the temperatures already in the late 20s.  It was really weird coming back from our ski trip last month and going from snow to shorts within 24 hours.  </p>

<p>Our trip was great and it was fun to be back on snow after 4 years.  Nora loved it and skiied the whole way down the mountain on our last day and was well and truly exhausted at the end of it.  We had a fab week with Lisa and Peter in NZ and it was very brave of them to share a house with a 3 year old and a 10 month old.  I will try and put up a pic of Nora in full flight on the snow.</p>

<p>What else have we been up to?  David was racing in Sydney last weekend and that involved a 12 hour drive down there.  We were trying to figure out where would we be after 12 hours driving in Europe and we thought somewhere in Italy.  We had 2 short stops, left at 8 in the morning and got there just before 8 at night. The girls did really well and didn't seem to mind. The journey back was 10 hours (the traffic was better).  He is out at Eastern Creek in a couple of weeks, again in Sydney but I am going to resist the temptation of doing that journey again.  He got a third on the Sat but the bike started playing up on the Sunday so not so good. He had recently changed over to Methanol and there are some teething problems with ignition and compression for those of you who understand all that stuff.</p>

<p>And yes Erin will be one is a few days.  I really cannot believe that a year has gone already.  She is so different to Nora and is so determined when she sets her mind to it. She is a daredevil like her dad and has given us a couple of real scares. She is such good fun  and the two of them get on so well.  We of course still cannot believe that we have 2 children and every day one of us still says exactly that. </p>

<p>The restaurants are going really and we are in the middle of school holidays which are really busy. We are on the move next year.  You know us always up to something and it has been over 4 years now.  The building we are in was sold and our new landlord wanted to buy us out of our lease.  So David did some pretty good negotiating and we move out on 3rd of July next year.  We are moving to a brand new restaurant which is currently 2 floors down in the ground. We are hoping to start fitting it out in time to move straight from one to the other next year.  the building is on schedule so it should as easy as that???  So at the moment we are designing a brand new kitchen etc which is very exciting.   </p>

<p>Anyway enough from me now hope you are all keeping well </p>

<p>with love </p>

<p>The Woolseys</p>
